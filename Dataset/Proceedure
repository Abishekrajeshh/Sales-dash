Steps to follow for an End-to-End Power BI Project

1) Gather Data
Collect the necessary data from databases, spreadsheets, or web services. Ensure accuracy and relevance.

2) Power Query – Data Extract, Transform & Load
Use Power Query Editor for data cleaning and transformation. This includes removing duplicates, handling missing values, merging datasets, and creating calculated columns.

3) Create a Date Table
To work with Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) time intelligence functions, a prerequisite is having at least one date table in the model.
Code for Creating Date Table in Power BI:
Note: Turn off Auto Date/Time for new files in Power BI Options Setting for better performance.

4) Create Data Model in Power BI Desktop
Design and create a data model that represents relationships between different tables. Establish keys and hierarchies for accurate analysis.

5) Develop Reports in Power BI Desktop
Use Power BI Desktop to create reports with visualizations such as charts, tables, and maps. Apply filters, slicers, and drill-through functionalities.

Key Visuals:
•	Sales By Product and Compare with Last Year
•	Sales By Month and Compare with Last Year
•	Sales of Top 5 Cities
•	Compare Profit by Channel with Previous Year
•	Sales By Customer and Compare with Last Year
•	Create Cards for Sales, Profit, Profit Margin & Products Sold

6) Implementing DAX Calculations
Use Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create calculated columns, measures, and calculated tables for complex calculations.

DAX Measures:
•	Sales = SUM(Sales_Data[Sales])
•	Sales PY = CALCULATE([Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(DateTable[Date]))
•	Sales vs PY = [Sales] - [Sales PY]
•	Sales vs PY % = DIVIDE([Sales vs PY],[Sales],0)
•	Products Sold = SUM(Sales_Data[Order Quantity])
•	Profit = SUM(Sales_Data[Profit])
•	Profit LY = CALCULATE([Profit], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(DateTable[Date]))
•	Profit Vs LY = [Profit] - [Profit LY]
•	Profit vs LY % = [Profit Vs LY]/[Profit]
•	Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Profit],[Sales],0)
•	Total Cost = SUM(Sales_Data[Total Cost])
